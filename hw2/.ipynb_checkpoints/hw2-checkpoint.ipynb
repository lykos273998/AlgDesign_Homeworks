    "The solution of the exercise begins with making a remark about the `Min-Heap` data structure that is a nearly complete binary tree wich given a total order satisfies the Heap property (each parent node satisfies the total order condition w.r.t his children).\n",
    "The solution proposed is based on the array-based representation of the heap seen in the lectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "The heap property and the fact that an heap is a tree complete up to the last level imply that in a `Min-Heap` the maximum will be found in one of the leaves, so if we consider the array based representation there will not be no more than $n/2$ leaves, given $n$ the total number of elements in the Heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea so is to search for the maximum amog the last $n/2$ elements. Since the heap may be unsorted the complexity of finding the maximum among them is requires $n/2$ comparisons so it belongs to $O(n)$\n",

    "Note how that by performing this replacement the heap property may be lost, so we have to restore it. The restoration goes on by pushing up to the root the node replaced. In a first time the value of the node is compared to his parent, if the heap property is broken the node is swapped with his parent. Than the procedure is iterated up one level. Note that in the worst case scenario the node will be pushed up to the second level, infact being the root the global minimum of the structure for sure no swaps will be performed\n",

The while loop goes on for a maximum of iteration equal to the heigth of the heap - 1. At each iteration are performed 3 operations. Due to the fact that the heap property may be restored before reaching the root of the tree the time complexity for this part is $O(\\log(n))$\n",
