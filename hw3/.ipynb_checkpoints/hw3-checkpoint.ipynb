    "The implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm with a Min-Heap requires a slightly modification of the Min-Heap and the nodes in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that Dijkstra's algorithm requires to, extract the root from the heap, find its neighbours and update the distance from the source of them. To do this 2 operation we have to work both on the graph and on the heap so at each step each node has to know \"where it is\" on the graph and on the heap.\n",

    "The solution is based on the design choice to give each node a member called `Heap_idx` which stores the position of the node on the Heap. Then the Heap is a `Heap_of_Nodes` in which every time a node is moved on the heap updates the `Heap_idx` member of the nodes, so the coherence is mantained through the algorithm and data structures.\n",

    "## 2.2 Bi-Directional Dijkstra alg\n",
    "Bidirectional version of Dijkstra's algorithm works on the idea of starting from a guess distance between source and target which is infinite. Then at each step a node is extracted from 2 queues, one starting from the source and one from the target. Once a node is finalized its index is put into an array. If at a certain point a node extracted from the source's queue is in the finalized of the target array the guess distance is updtated and that node is saved as a \"joint\". The iteration continues while the queues are empty or a path is found. \n",
    "\n",
    "A path is found whenever we extract 2 nodes and the sum of their distance is greater than the guessed one. In particular, the nodes extracted from the queues are the ones which minimum distance respectively to the source and the target. Since they were new, so they they arent discovered neither by the forward search neither by the backward search, for sure from now on to connect the regions the path will be longer than the guessed distance, so the optimal path has been already discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how to relate it with the contraction hierarchy? The idea in this case is to accept the relaxation of the nodes only if the arc is gaining in importance, then once the path is found the full shortest path is unveiled by unpacking all shortcuts taken. This has to be done both in the fwd search and in the bwd. Following the example seen in lessons which suggested to use in the \"downward graph\" a backward search, this means that at each step both fwd and bwd search are going into nodes of growing importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that since the graph is decorated by shortcuts we need a way to unpack them. This is achieved using another auxilary matrix, (`shortcuts_taken[i,j]`) in which is stored the node bypassed by a shortcut going from i to j. Once a path is found by the search each edge is tested if it is a shortcut, and if it is the full path is unpacked, in detail if a shortcut bypasses more than one node all sub paths are recursively unpacked if they are also shortcuts, stopping if a \"pure path\" is discovered\n",
    "\n",
    "A little bit of effort on the human side is needed to find in certain pathological cases why different variants output different paths, but for the tests I have done it happens that different variants found different equivalent paths. To test correctness 3 cases are compared. Original DIJKSTRA, BI-DIJKSTRA with no shorcuts, BI-DIJKSTRA working on the full contraction hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: By default the importance of the nodes is set to 0. The relaxation step is done on the condition `u.importance >= v.importance` So if nodes have all the same importance the algorithm implemented is a bi directional Dijkstra\n"
